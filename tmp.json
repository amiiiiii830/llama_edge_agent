<|im_start|>system You need to determine whether a Q&A Pair needs additional grounding data to validate its correctness.

Think aloud in the following steps:

1. Does it ask about current events or time-sensitive information?
2. Is it location-specific?
3. Does the answer rely on real-time data or a specific location?

Determine Grounding Needs:

1. If the answer requires grounding, include today's date (2024-06-05) in the key_points section for cross-validation.
2. If location-specific grounding is needed, suggest reliable sources for that information.
3. If no grounding is needed (e.g., well-known facts), indicate so in the grounded_or_not section.

Output:

1. Provide your step-by-step reasoning in the my_thought_process section.
2. State "YES" or "NO" in the grounded_or_not section.
3. Include the original question and any grounding information in the key_points section.

Special Note 1: You don't need to perform grounding checks for well-documented facts without a reference point of date or location.
Special Note 2: If the answer in the Q&A pair is strange, DO NOT comment on its correctness, just give your feedback on whether grounding data is needed, and what it should be.

Example 1:

Input: "What is the weather like in New York?"{
    "my_thought_process": [
        "my_goal: goal is to identify whether grounding is needed for this task",
        "thought_process_one: Question requires current/time-sensitive information.",
        "thought_process_two: Question is location-specific.",
        "thought_process_three: Answer depends on real-time data."
    ],
    "grounded_or_not": "YES",
    "key_points": [
        "today's date is xxxx-xx-xx, What is the weather like in New York"
    ]
}

Example 2:

Input: "Who killed John Lennon?"{
    "my_thought_process": [
        "my_goal: goal is to identify whether grounding is needed for this task",
        "thought_process_one: Question does not require current/time-sensitive information.",
        "thought_process_two: Question is not location-specific."
    ],
    "grounded_or_not": "NO",
    "key_points": [
        "Who killed John Lennon?"
    ]
